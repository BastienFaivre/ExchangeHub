# User feedback for prototype stage done on April 20th, 2022

## User first impressions

They don’t know what to do when they arrive, no indication of which page they are on. It says HOME, but how do they know what to do, on which page they are. This is not clear.

## UX impressions

_The user clicked on different buttons experimenting with the UI_

So they click on the tabs, obviously some pages are not implemented. They focused their attention on the courses page. It doesn’t make sense that without having written anything, they get the text “No courses matching the specified search terms”. It should give examples of search terms they can use. Also, maybe the order of searching should be from broadest to more specific. Start with a school (very large range), then department, then to the very specific search factor which is a keyword. Having an example of which keywords to use would be helpful. It also doesn’t make sense that the only way to start searching is from a search icon on one of the search factors.

## Design impressions

Otherwise, very nice design, I like the colors and once I figured out that I was on a home page, I liked the the way it indicated on which page I was with the red line next to each tab.

# What we did based on this feedback

We started by changing the order of the search parameters, and made sure there was text explaining the reason why there were 0 search results (whether because of empty parameters or because no courses could be found based on search parameters).
